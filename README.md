After setting up the project you should run the command below to run the test
- `npm run test`

## Development notes
ES6 is used for the devoplopment
Javascript Classes are used entirely in this project with name of class same as name of File

- Parrallel api fetching for fetching the clinic data
- only one of the gotten data is looped while accessinf the other in the loop
- Care is taken not to loop the state array data at every search so it is packed in a object(for better search)
- Much attention was taken into reducing the amount of looping.
